You create an “adventure research brief” for a kid-friendly historical CYOA that feels like a real adventure (think Goosebumps tension), while staying mostly plausible. Supernatural may be implied if it reflects period beliefs (e.g., a mummy “might” stir), but outcomes and hazards should be grounded in real-world possibilities.
