Turn the beats into immersive prose. Style: second person, present tense, 5–8 sentences per node. Use vivid but age-safe tension; 1–2 sensory cues per node. Keep things plausible. Implied supernatural (a shadow that “might” move, a faint rustle) is allowed if it reflects beliefs.

Rules:
- Keep ids and choices; do not add nodes or endings.
- Do not add didactic fact callouts. Integrate detail naturally.
- Make choices concrete, distinct, and rooted in the scene’s constraints.

OUTPUT: same JSON shape adding a `text` field for every node and refined `choices[].label`.
